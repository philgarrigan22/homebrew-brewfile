# Homebrew Brewfile

## Description

- This is a small repo containing my Homebrew Brewfile.
- A Brewfile is a list of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) packages and casks that can be installed in a batch by [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle).
- I added the Brewfile in a separate repo, instead of in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/br3ndonland/dotfiles), for compatibility with [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap).
